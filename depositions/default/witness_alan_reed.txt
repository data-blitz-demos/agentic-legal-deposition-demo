Deposition of Alan Reed
Date: April 17, 2025
Role: Safety Supervisor

I arrived shortly before 9:00 a.m. on March 3, 2025.
Jane Doe informed me around 9:15 a.m. that rack C had been hit by a forklift.
When I checked, I observed fresh impact damage and a solvent leak from one drum.
I reviewed camera logs later and noted that the loading dock camera had no feed between 8:30 and 9:45 a.m.
