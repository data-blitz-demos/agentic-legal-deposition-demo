Deposition of Jane Doe
Date: April 14, 2025
Role: Operations Manager

I arrived at the warehouse at about 8:45 a.m. on March 3, 2025.
The loading dock camera was not functioning that morning.
I personally saw the forklift operated by Mark Rivera strike pallet rack C around 9:10 a.m.
The damaged rack held solvent drums, and one drum leaked.
I told safety supervisor Alan Reed immediately.
