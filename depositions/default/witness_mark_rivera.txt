Deposition of Mark Rivera
Date: April 15, 2025
Role: Forklift Operator

On March 3, 2025, I started my shift at 10:00 a.m.
I did not drive any forklift before 10:15 a.m.
I did not strike any pallet rack that day.
The loading dock camera was operating normally as far as I know.
I first heard about a leak around 11:30 a.m.
