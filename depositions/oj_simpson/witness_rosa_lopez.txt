Deposition of Rosa Lopez
Date: March 21, 1995
Role: Housekeeper

On June 12, 1994, I was working at the Rockingham property in the evening hours.
Before leaving, I observed the white Bronco parked outside and noted the gate area was secured.
I did not see Mr. Simpson at the property during the period immediately before my departure.
My recollection is based on my normal cleaning schedule and the time I left the premises.
I later provided these observations to investigators during follow-up interviews.
