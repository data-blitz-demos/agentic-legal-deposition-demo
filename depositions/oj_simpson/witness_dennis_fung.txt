Deposition of Dennis Fung
Date: April 4, 1995
Role: LAPD Criminalist

I processed physical evidence at both Bundy and Rockingham locations on June 13, 1994.
At each collection point, I used standard swab and packaging methods and logged item identifiers.
I collected blood samples, control swabs, and selected trace items for later laboratory analysis.
Collection sequence was documented in my notes and reflected in evidence booking records.
My testimony addresses collection steps, contamination controls, and chain-of-custody entries.
