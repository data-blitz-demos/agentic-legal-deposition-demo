Deposition of Thano Peratis
Date: April 6, 1995
Role: Registered Nurse

On June 13, 1994, I performed a medically supervised blood draw from Mr. Simpson.
The draw occurred under law-enforcement presence and was labeled for evidentiary handling.
I followed standard venipuncture protocol and transferred the sample to assigned officers.
My documentation included draw time, sample labeling, and transfer confirmation.
My testimony focuses on medical procedure and handoff steps rather than crime scene activity.
