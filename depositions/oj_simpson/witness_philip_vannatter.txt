Deposition of Philip Vannatter
Date: March 20, 1995
Role: Detecting Officer

On June 13, 1994, I supervised portions of evidence handling related to blood reference samples.
A reference vial drawn from Mr. Simpson was transferred under police custody for laboratory submission.
During that same date, I returned between facilities and scene locations while maintaining chain-of-custody notes.
I recorded evidence transport times and receiving personnel in the case paperwork.
My testimony concerns handling procedures, timing, and documentation of those transfers.
