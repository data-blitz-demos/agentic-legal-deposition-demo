Deposition of Allan Park
Date: March 8, 1995
Role: Chauffeur

On June 12, 1994, I arrived at the Rockingham residence at approximately 10:25 p.m. for a scheduled airport pickup.
I rang the intercom several times and did not receive an immediate response.
At around 10:55 p.m., I saw a tall figure move across the front entry area toward the house.
I finally made contact close to 11:40 p.m., and we departed for the airport shortly after.
I did not see any police presence while waiting outside.
