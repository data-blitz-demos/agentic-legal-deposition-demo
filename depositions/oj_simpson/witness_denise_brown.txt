Deposition of Denise Brown
Date: April 11, 1995
Role: Family Member Witness

I am Nicole Brown Simpson's sister and had regular contact with her before June 1994.
In months before the incident, Nicole described fear and recurring conflict involving Mr. Simpson.
I understood those statements as serious concerns about her personal safety.
After June 12, 1994, I provided this history to investigators and later in court proceedings.
My testimony addresses prior statements, family communications, and context for the relationship.
