Deposition of Mark Fuhrman
Date: March 15, 1995
Role: Detecting Officer

In the early morning hours of June 13, 1994, I entered the Rockingham property during a welfare check.
At approximately 5:15 a.m., I observed what appeared to be a single leather glove behind the guest house pathway.
I also noted blood drops leading from a vehicle area toward the residence entry.
The side gate appeared partly open when I first observed the rear approach.
I documented these observations in my field notes before evidence collection teams arrived.
