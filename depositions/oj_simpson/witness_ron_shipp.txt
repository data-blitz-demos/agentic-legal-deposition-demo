Deposition of Ron Shipp
Date: March 23, 1995
Role: Former LAPD Officer and Personal Acquaintance

I had known Mr. Simpson for years prior to the events of June 1994.
In a conversation after the homicides, I observed an injury on his left hand area.
I recalled statements expressing distress about Nicole Brown Simpson and the events of that night.
I reported what I observed and heard to investigators as part of their interview process.
My testimony concerns demeanor, statements, and the timing of those interactions.
