Deposition of Brian "Kato" Kaelin
Date: March 10, 1995
Role: House Guest

On the night of June 12, 1994, I was in the guest house on the Rockingham property.
At about 10:40 p.m., I heard three loud thumps against the outside wall near the air conditioner.
Before that noise, I did not notice anyone walking near my walkway.
After the noise, I went toward the main house area and observed a dark glove-like object near the path.
I later spoke with officers after sunrise when they were examining the property.
