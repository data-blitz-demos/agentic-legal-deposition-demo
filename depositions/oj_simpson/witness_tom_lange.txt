Deposition of Tom Lange
Date: March 16, 1995
Role: Lead Detective

In the early hours of June 13, 1994, I was assigned to the homicide investigation at Bundy Drive.
At approximately 4:05 a.m., I observed multiple blood evidence markers near the walkway and entry area.
Later that morning, our team coordinated follow-up at Rockingham after concern about Mr. Simpson's welfare.
I observed a blood trail pattern and documented sequence-of-discovery notes before major scene processing.
All scene actions were entered into the investigative log as the day progressed.
