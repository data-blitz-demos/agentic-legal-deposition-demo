Deposition of Martin Keller
Date: March 1, 2024
Role: Former Bergdorf Security Manager (Simulated)

Note: This is a simulated deposition file for software testing and demo purposes. Witness is fictionalized for this demo set.

I managed security operations at Bergdorf Goodman in the mid-1990s.
Our camera coverage in 1996 did not include inside dressing rooms and had partial blind spots on some floors.
To my knowledge, video retention was short, typically overwritten within days unless an incident was reported.
I do not recall a formal incident report matching this allegation in spring 1996.
I also cannot rule out an unreported event in an area with limited camera coverage.
