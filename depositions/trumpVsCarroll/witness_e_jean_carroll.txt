I first met Donald Trump in social and media circles in the late 1980s.
In spring 1996, I encountered him near the entrance area at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan.
He recognized me and asked for advice about a gift, and we went to the lingerie floor.
After playful conversation in the fitting-room area, I allege he forced himself on me in a dressing room.
I left the store quickly and did not file a police report that day.
I told two friends shortly after the incident, and they advised me in different ways about whether to report publicly.
I did not go public until many years later because I feared retaliation and humiliation.
When I later heard statements denying the event and denying that he knew me, I felt compelled to speak publicly.
I stand by my account that the encounter occurred in the mid-1990s, in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman.
