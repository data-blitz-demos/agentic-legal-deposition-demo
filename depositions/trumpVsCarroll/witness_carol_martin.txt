E. Jean Carroll told me about an encounter with Donald Trump shortly after it happened.
My memory is that the call occurred within a few days, not necessarily the same night.
She described being upset, confused, and unsure whether to tell anyone else.
I advised her to move on and avoid escalating a public conflict with a powerful person.
Over the years she referenced the same store location and same general timeline in the mid-1990s.
