Role: Former Magazine Colleague (Simulated)

Note: This is a simulated deposition file for software testing and demo purposes. Witness is fictionalized for this demo set.

I knew E. Jean Carroll professionally in New York media circles.
She was familiar with high-profile figures and occasionally described chance encounters in public settings.
In the late 1990s, she referenced an upsetting encounter involving Donald Trump at a department store.
I cannot testify to direct personal knowledge of the event itself.
My recollection is that she was reluctant to discuss details publicly for many years.
