I worked on a nearby floor at Bergdorf Goodman around 1995 and 1996.
I remember seeing Donald Trump in the store on multiple occasions.
My recollection is that he was usually accompanied by at least one staff member or associate.
I do not remember the specific date of the alleged incident.
I cannot confirm who entered or exited any dressing room during the period in question.
The store was busy in spring months, and staff movement near fitting rooms was common.
