Deposition of Alex Rivera
Date: March 15, 2024
Role: Media Timeline Analyst (Simulated)

Note: This is a simulated deposition file for software testing and demo purposes. Witness is fictionalized for this demo set.

I compiled a public-statement timeline for allegations and responses related to this case.
My analysis showed major publicity spikes after publication of allegations and after subsequent public denials.
I observed inconsistencies across public interviews about whether the parties had ever met.
My timeline work is based on media records, not first-hand witness observation.
I cannot verify what occurred in the dressing room, only the chronology of public statements.
