E. Jean Carroll called me shortly after the alleged incident and sounded shaken.
She told me she had a frightening encounter with Donald Trump in a department store dressing-room area.
My recollection is that she called the same day in the evening, though I cannot produce a phone record.
I advised her that what she described sounded serious and she should consider going to police.
She said she was embarrassed and worried no one would believe her.
In later years, her account to me remained materially consistent.
